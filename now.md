I added an initial css-animated logo to the Contact Page. It needs work yet.

I deleted several posts that are not working on the github site. I
was unable to figure out why they quit working there. That did not solve my problem of my post pages working locally but not on github.

Prior to the above, I was working on (and will continue to improve upon) displaying [SVG images]({{ '/web/2020/02/20/SVG-Animations' }}) along with their animation on this jekyll github-pages site. The following is an animated svg image.

{::nomarkdown}
<svg width="200" height=200>
    <circle id="circle-fade" cx="150" cy="100" r="10" fill="blue"/>
</svg>
