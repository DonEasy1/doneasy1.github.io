Long story short, Don is back to driving and operating generators for shows, as well as restarting his company, Easy Power for rental and repair of motion picture related equipment.

He is currently in Las Vegas nearing the end of the season for, "Obliterated!" In December, he will be winding up the year's office work for Easy Power.
