The next post links are not working. I have been working this evening on this issue. All I can figure at the moment is that it is an issue with github, since all the other post links on this page work, and all the links to posts work on my local machine. All the pages were recreated, so I believe that has something to do with it. I will wait to see if the problem resolves itself within a day or 2. 

I just deleted the site on github and am starting an new repository for this website. I have done this 2 or 3 times in similar but different fashion to no avail.
