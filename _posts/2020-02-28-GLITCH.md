The next post links (my 3 original posts for which I made entirely new md files) are not working. I have been working this evening on this issue. All I can figure at the moment is that it is an issue with github, since all the other post links on this page work, and all the links to posts work on my local machine. All the pages were recreated. I will wait to see if the problem resolves itself within a day or 2, as it seems beyond my control, ie a github problem.

I just deleted the site on github and am starting an new repository for this website. I have done this 2 or 3 times in similar but different fashion to no avail. I even removed git locally and reinitialized it.
